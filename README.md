## Project Name: Zentrades Task - 3 Login Dashboard Frontend

### Description:
This project is a basic frontend implementation of a login dashboard with specific functionality requirements for the username and password fields.

### Functionality:
The login dashboard implements the following functionalities:
1. **Username Validation:** The username field only accepts input in email format. JavaScript validation is applied to ensure the entered value matches the email format.

2. **Password Masking:** The password field is masked, ensuring that the entered characters are not visible to the user.

3. **Password Requirements:** Password validation restricts the use of special characters except for '@' and enforces the presence of an uppercase letter and a number.

### Implementation Details:
The project was developed using HTML and JavaScript. Key functionalities were implemented as follows:

1. **Username Validation (Email Format):** JavaScript validation is applied to the username field to ensure it only accepts input in email format.

2. **Password Masking:** The password field is configured as a masked field, ensuring that the entered characters are hidden from view.

3. **Password Requirements Validation:** JavaScript validation enforces password requirements, allowing only the use of '@' as a special character and ensuring the presence of at least one uppercase letter and one number.
